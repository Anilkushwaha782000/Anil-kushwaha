<h3 style="color:Coral;text-align:center;">Learn How To Design </h3><br><br>
<h4>What Is Design</h4><br>
<p class="fw-normal lh-base">Generally speaking, it is the process of envisioning and planning the creation of objects,interactive systems, buildings, vehicles, etc. It user-centered, i.e. users are at the heart of the design thinking approach. It is about creating solutions for people, physical items or more abstract systems to address a need or a problem. 
It is a very broad concept and its meaning can greatly vary from one field to another. It and permeates many aspects of our lives and branches out into many different subgenres, from product design, sound , virtual reality , interaction , to designing cars, video games, software interfaces, the home and offices interior etc. Schools adapted to the market's evolution accordingly by creating graduate and postgraduate programs in Design.<br><br>
<h4>The key concepts of design</h4><br>
<h6>Art or science?</h6><br>
While not being exactly an art nor a science, it takes elements from both. Art is about creating something that expresses the author’s vision, ideas and feelings. While designers can express feelings and leave impressions through their work, doing so is not their prime objective.So it takes the creating aspect of art, as it is about crafting an item, a tool, an experience even.<br><br>
<h6>Design is at the service of the people--</h6><br>
On the other hand, it takes the problem-solving aspect of science. It exists primarily to address a particular need. To quote Steve Jobs: “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”<br><br>
<h6>The creative design process--</h6><br>
Problems are best solved when approached in a comprehensive and systemic way. The goal of this process is to guide you and organize your work to turn ideas into concrete solutions. Designers do research and collect information about the problem they are considering: who is person facing this problem? Why? How are other people trying to solve it? From this research, they make a general hypothesis and identify the main features should be part of the answer. Then with these key aspects in mind it’s time to experiment different solutions and iterate. This last part is about learning from what works, what doesn’t to adapt your solution to fit the user’s need best. <br><br>
<h6> Great design is invisible--</h6> <br>
It is achieved when the user doesn’t even notice its presence. This principle is particularly true in interaction design. Navigating a user interface should feel natural and unhindered. The user should be able to understand its rules and the meaning of its elements almost immediately. The user is guided by an invisible hand made of colors, shapes, contrast, repetitions. 
</p><br>
<h4>Things You Should Know About Design and Design Thinking</h4><br>
<p class="fw-normal lh-base"> There are many myths passed on from the greater culture that define how we think about Design. Some people think that to design, one must be an artist. Or that design comes as a flash of light into the minds of certain privileged people.<br>
<h5>Here are the things I’d like to share with you about design and design thinking.</h5><br>
<h4>1.Design process</h4><br>
Design is an approach to problem-solving that applies the cognitive activities of design thinking. These are the processes designers leverage to ideate and create solutions.
Paula Sirar, design thinking advocate defines it like this, “Design Thinking is a creative process of thinking backwards from people, that leads to design of a service, a product or [something] else, based on the conclusions of the knowledge gathered in the process.”<br><br>
<h4>2. Design requires empathy</h4><br>
Design involves putting yourself in the shoes of the user, whether it is a customer or a learner.It means seeing the world through their eyes. Effective designs shift the thinking from technology or objects to people. It’s based on what humans need to improve their situation— to make things better and easier.<br><br>
<h4>3. Design takes time</h4><br>
It’s difficult to be creative on demand. Some solutions take time to simmer and brew. Considering that design involves iterative prototypes, you need to allow time for solutions to unfold.<br><br>
<h4>4.Design impacts business</h4><br>
Design thinking impacts the bottom line. It transforms the approach to business and product or service development from one of calculating numbers to a human-centered approach. Which one do you think is more likely to meet the needs of customers, users and learners?<br><br>
<h4>5.Design can change society (and the world of learning)</h4><br>
Design may be more powerful that you think. Consider that every object in your home and office has been designed.How many of them were powerful enough to change the way the world works? Think of every social program that changes lives and every business or service that delights its customers. These were designed through hard thinking, feedback and iteration.
In the world of learning, we can think about what we would like to change … about new approaches for helping people get the information and skills they want. Then we can use design thinking to make a difference.
